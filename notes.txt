-Using wrapper types or primitives:
Wrapper types allows null values, so when the column is null, we know it wasn't set,
but with primitives e.g int we don't know if 0 was set, or not set (default value)

-GenerationType
SEQUENCE is not possible in mysql, but for other dbs is the preffered strategy.
IDENTITY for mysql (be sure to check AI in DB)
